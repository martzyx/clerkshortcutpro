## Installation

**If using chrome:**
https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/clerkshortcutpro/cgacjinjmhilbalfehjefkebkjlomkhl

**If using firefox:**
https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/clerkshortcutpro/

## How to Customize options and keybinds (Chrome only)

You can customize the keyboard shortcuts according to your preference by following these steps:

Open the Clerk.io extension options by clicking on the extension icon in your browser toolbar.

In the options page, you will find the settings for the keyboard shortcuts.

Enable or disable the desired shortcuts by toggling the corresponding checkboxes.

To change the default keyboard shortcuts, click on the input field for the shortcut you want to modify and press the desired key. The input field will be automatically updated with the selected key.

To enable/disable the Delete Search Designs button, click on the checkbox.

Click the "Save Settings" button to save your changes.

Remember, this extension is meant to enhance your navigation and user experience within the my.clerk.io interface. I hope you find them useful and time-saving.

## Usage of headline translations for Recommendations

When viewing best-practice content in Recommendations > Content in my.clerk.io, you will be able to see buttons next to the input field (DK,SE,IT, etc.) of the headline section. When clicking on a button, the translated headline will be copied to your clipboard, so that you can paste it in the input field.

**Important:** it only works on main content generated by the setup guide (excluding powerstep, blogs, and random content...).

_(Side note: I tried making it auto-fill, but Angular doesn't allow that to be saved. There needs to be some user input.)_

## Usage of Delete Search Designs

Whenever you are on my.clerk.io > search designs, refresh the page, and you should see a button at the bottom.
When clicking this button, it deletes all designs that match the names of the default designs.
In chrome, you can enable/disable this in the options section of the extension.
